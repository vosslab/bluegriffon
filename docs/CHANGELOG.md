# Changelog

## 2026-02-16

- Created [bluegriffon/config/gecko_esr140_toolchain_ld64.patch](../bluegriffon/config/gecko_esr140_toolchain_ld64.patch) to fix ld64 linker detection on Xcode 16+ for both target and host linker (Apple removed "Logging ld64 options" stderr message; also falls back to ld64 on Darwin when no linker is specified)
- Created [bluegriffon/config/gecko_esr140_gen_last_modified.patch](../bluegriffon/config/gecko_esr140_gen_last_modified.patch) to add `bluegriffon` as a valid `MOZ_BUILD_APP` in `gen_last_modified.py`
- Updated [build.sh](../build.sh) to apply required ESR 140 Gecko tree patches automatically during `setup` (separate from broken 2017 patches)
- Clarified in [docs/USAGE.md](USAGE.md), [docs/INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md), and [build.sh](../build.sh) that **patches are NOT required** for BlueGriffon builds (including ARM64 macOS)
- Improved [build.sh](../build.sh) patch diagnostics to show why patches fail when `--apply-patches` is used experimentally
- Switched [build.sh](../build.sh) patch engine from GNU `patch` to `git apply` with per-file progress reporting
- Documented that existing patches are from 2017 (Firefox 55 era) and incompatible with ESR 140 - they exist for historical reference only
- Enabled ccache compiler cache in [bluegriffon/config/mozconfig.macosx](../bluegriffon/config/mozconfig.macosx) for 5-10x faster rebuilds
- Added ccache to [Brewfile](../Brewfile) as required build dependency
- Updated [docs/INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) to document ccache requirement

- **Build succeeds on macOS ARM64 with Gecko ESR 140** -- first successful compilation, linking, and packaging of BlueGriffon on modern Gecko
- Modernized [app/nsEditorApp.cpp](../bluegriffon/app/nsEditorApp.cpp) for ESR 140: guarded `WindowsDllBlocklist.h` include with `#ifdef XP_WIN`, added `XREShellData.h` include, updated `InitXPCOMGlue()` to use no-arg `BinaryPath::Get()` and `Result`-based `GetBootstrap` API
- Added CoreFoundation framework linkage to [app/moz.build](../bluegriffon/app/moz.build) for macOS (fixes undefined symbols for `CFBundleCopyExecutableURL` etc.)
- Replaced removed `nsXPIDLString.h` with `nsString.h` in [diOSIntegrationFactory.cpp](../bluegriffon/src/diOSIntegration.mac/diOSIntegrationFactory.cpp)
- Converted macOS OS integration component from old `mozilla::Module`/`NSMODULE_DEFN` registration to modern `components.conf` static registration system; created [components.conf](../bluegriffon/src/diOSIntegration.mac/components.conf)
- Patched Gecko `services/settings/dumps/gen_last_modified.py` to recognize `bluegriffon` as a valid `MOZ_BUILD_APP` platform
- Restructured [app/Makefile.in](../bluegriffon/app/Makefile.in): fixed binary copy path to use `$(DIST)/bin/`, skipped `channel-prefs.js` preprocessing on macOS (matches Firefox ESR 140), fixed `tools repackage` target to reference `$(DIST)/bin/$(MOZ_APP_NAME)`, removed dead `LIBXUL_SDK` blocks
- Added `APP_VERSION`, `CODE_NAME`, and `GRE_BUILDID` DEFINES to [base/moz.build](../bluegriffon/base/moz.build) (migrated from Makefile.in shell commands)
- Replaced removed `nsIDOMNode` with `nsISupports` in 8 BlueGriffon IDL files under [bluegriffon/src/dibgutils/](../bluegriffon/src/dibgutils/) (`diIAttrChangedTxn.idl`, `diIAttrNameChangedTxn.idl`, `diIInnerHtmlChangedTxn.idl`, `diINodeInsertionTxn.idl`, `diIRemoveAttributeNSTxn.idl`, `diISetAttributeNSTxn.idl`, `diIStyleAttrChangeTxn.idl`, `diITextNodeChangedTxn.idl`) to fix XPIDL build error with ESR 140 where `nsIDOMNode` is no longer a scriptable interface
- Removed unused `interface nsIDOMNode;` forward declaration from [diIChangeFileStylesheetTxn.idl](../bluegriffon/src/dibgutils/diIChangeFileStylesheetTxn.idl)
- Updated [config/gecko_dev_idl.patch](../bluegriffon/config/gecko_dev_idl.patch) to replace `nsIDOMNode` with `nsISupports` in `nsIEditorMouseObserver` method signatures
- Removed `DEFINES` from all 11 Makefile.in files under `bluegriffon/` (blocked by ESR 140 build system) and migrated them to corresponding moz.build files where possible; created new moz.build files for `installer/` and `installer/windows/`
- Created [Brewfile](../Brewfile) with macOS Homebrew build dependencies (`autoconf`, `python@3.12`)
- Added `--enable-linker=ld64` to [config/mozconfig.macosx](../config/mozconfig.macosx) to fix "Failed to find an adequate linker" error on macOS with Xcode clang 16+ (uses Apple's native linker instead of requiring LLVM `lld`)
- Patched Gecko `toolchain.configure` ld64 detection to recognize Apple's new linker (Xcode 16+ no longer prints "Logging ld64 options")
- Ported [confvars.sh](../confvars.sh) for ESR 140: moved `MOZ_APP_ID`, `MOZ_APP_VENDOR`, `MOZ_DEVTOOLS` to [moz.configure](../moz.configure) as `imply_option()` calls; removed obsolete variables no longer recognized by Gecko
- Changed [build.sh](../build.sh) patches from opt-out (`--skip-patches`) to opt-in (`--apply-patches`) since content patch needs updating for ESR 140
- Updated [docs/INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) with `brew bundle` prerequisite and resolved Brewfile known gap
- Added `Brewfile` to [docs/FILE_STRUCTURE.md](FILE_STRUCTURE.md) root files listing

- Created `VERSION` file at repo root (synced with `config/version.txt` at `3.2`)
- Updated [docs/AUTHORS.md](AUTHORS.md) to add Daniel Glazman as original author
- Rewrote [app/macversion.py](../app/macversion.py) to replace deprecated `optparse` with `argparse`, add type hints, use f-strings, use tabs for indentation, and add function separator comments
- Updated [config/mozconfig.macosx](../config/mozconfig.macosx): fixed header to say macOS instead of WIN32, updated to macOS 14+/Xcode 16+, changed SDK path to generic `MacOSX.sdk`, set minimum target to macOS 12.0
